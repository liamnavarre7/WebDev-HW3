        <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Liam Navarre. I'm currently a Junior at Gonzaga University.
    I'm working towards my degree in computer science with a bachelors of science.
    I'm also minoring in math in order to keep the logical thinking involved in the subject
    present in my life. I'm 21 years old and I expect to graduate Spring of 2024. I'm 
    interested in game development and data science.
